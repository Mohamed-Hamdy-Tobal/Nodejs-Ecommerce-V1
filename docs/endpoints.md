## ‚öôÔ∏è Filtering Engine

The API uses a reusable dynamic filtering system built with:

- `FilterEngine`: Transforms query params into MongoDB-compatible filters.
- `FilterFactory`: Retrieves pre-configured filters per entity from `filterConfigs`.

This setup allows fast development and clean, reusable logic across models.

```http
GET /api/v1/product?brand=Samsung&price_gte=500&search=smartphone&sort=-price&fields=title,price
